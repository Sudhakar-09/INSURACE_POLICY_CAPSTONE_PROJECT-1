# Insurance-Me DevOps Project


Insurance-Me DevOps project adopts microservices using Spring Boot on AWS, resolving monolithic challenges. CI/CD automation with Git, Jenkins, Maven, Docker, Terraform, and Ansible accelerates code delivery. Selenium ensures automated testing, while Prometheus and Grafana monitor deployments. GitHub hosts the project, promoting collaboration and version control. üöÄüîßüåê


# 1. Project Creation and Coding

### Project Structure with Spring.io & Eclipse-IDE:

 1. Utilized Spring Initializer to create a well-structured Spring Boot project.
Chose relevant dependencies for web development and data storage.

### CRUD Endpoints in Java:

2. Implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for account management.
Utilized Spring Boot features for efficient development.

### JUnit Test Cases:

3. Wrote comprehensive JUnit test cases to ensure the functionality of the implemented endpoints.
Used Mockito for mocking external dependencies in testing.

### Maven for Continuous Build:

4. Integrated Maven for continuous build processes.
Configured Maven in the Jenkins pipeline for seamless builds.

### Automated Selenium Testing:

5. Integrated Selenium WebDriver with TestNG for automated end-to-end testing.
Created test scripts to validate the functionality of the deployed application.
Implemented Emailable Report generation for clear and detailed test results.
# 2. Version Control and Collaboration

Pushed the project code to a GitHub repository.
# 3. Continuous Integration and Deployment

### CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins:

Created CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins freestyle jobs.
Utilized shell scripting for automating various stages of the pipeline.

### Docker Containerization:

Dockerized the application for consistent deployment across different environments.

### Configuration Management with Ansible:

Wrote Ansible playbooks for automated configuration of servers.

### Automated Testing in CI/CD:

Integrated automated Selenium tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
Ensured tests are executed after each deployment to verify application functionality.
# 4. Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

### Prometheus Setup:

Configured Prometheus for collecting and monitoring application metrics.

### Grafana Dashboard:

Set up Grafana to visualize key metrics such as CPU utilization, disk space, and memory.
